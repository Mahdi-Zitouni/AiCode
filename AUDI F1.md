## Executive Summary

I've analyzed the 5 use case categories with 12 sub-components. As a single Salesforce expert, I recommend a **phased approach over 6-8 months** focusing on core functionality first, then expanding to advanced features.

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture
```
Salesforce CRM (Foundation)
    ↓
Marketing Cloud (Journey Orchestration)
    ↓
Experience Cloud (User Interface)
    ↓
Data Cloud (Analytics & Segmentation)
```

### Key Custom Objects Needed
1. **Fan_Profile__c** - User profiles and preferences
2. **Onboarding_Journey__c** - Track user progress
3. **Loyalty_Points__c** - Gamification system
4. **Content_Engagement__c** - Track video/content interactions
5. **Campaign_Participation__c** - Track campaign involvement

### Integration Strategy
- **BigQuery** → Data Cloud (analytics data)
- **Audi ID** → Salesforce CRM (authentication)
- **WhatsApp** → MuleSoft → Marketing Cloud (messaging)
- **Social Media** → Data Cloud (UGC collection)

## Resource Requirements

### Salesforce Licenses (Monthly)
- **Salesforce CRM**: $150/user (2-3 users)
- **Marketing Cloud**: $1,250/month (basic plan)
- **Experience Cloud**: $10/user/month (community users)
- **Data Cloud**: $10,000/month (basic plan)
- **Total**: ~$12,000/month

### Development Timeline
- **Month 1-2**: Core platform setup and basic flows
- **Month 3-4**: Engagement features and surveys
- **Month 5-6**: Content management and loyalty
- **Month 7-8**: Advanced integrations

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets
- User registration completion rate: >80%
- Email open rates: >25%
- Journey completion rate: >60%

### Phase 2 Targets
- Survey participation rate: >40%
- Reveal campaign engagement: >50%
- User segmentation accuracy: >90%

### Phase 3 Targets
- Content engagement rate: >30%
- Loyalty program participation: >25%
- User retention rate: >70%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Single expert limitation**: Phased approach allows learning and adaptation
- **Integration complexity**: Start with simple integrations, add complexity gradually
- **User adoption**: Focus on user experience and gamification

### Business Risks
- **Timeline delays**: Built-in buffer time in each phase
- **Scope creep**: Clear phase boundaries and deliverables
- **Budget constraints**: Modular approach allows for budget adjustments

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Confirm budget approval** for Phase 1 ($24,000 for 2 months)
2. **Set up Salesforce org** and basic configuration
3. **Begin Phase 1 development** with Activation Campaign

### Questions for Discussion
1. **What's the target go-live date?** (I recommend 6-8 months)
2. **Which use cases are business-critical?** (I suggest starting with Activation + Registration)
3. **What's the budget range?** (Phase 1: $24K, Full project: $96K)
4. **Do you have existing Salesforce infrastructure?** (Affects setup time)
5. **What's the expected user volume?** (Affects license requirements)

## Alternative Approach: MVP in 3 Months

If timeline is critical, I can deliver a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** in 3 months:

**MVP Scope:**
- Basic user registration and onboarding
- Simple email automation
- Basic community portal
- One survey/poll system
- Simple loyalty points

**MVP Cost:** $36,000 (3 months)
**MVP Products:** Salesforce CRM + Marketing Cloud + Experience Cloud
